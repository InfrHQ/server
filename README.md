## What is Infr?

Infr is a platform for data collection, storage, & retrieval that you can self-host. It is designed to be API-first & modular, so that you can easily add new data sources, storage backends, and retrieval methods.

## Why Infr?

Infr is built to be a open-source, API first & performant server which allows all your favourite apps & LLMs to personalise themselves to you.

## How does it work?

Infr server is a Python server that exposes a REST API to store, clean & query data. All actions are authorized by API keys, which can be generated by the Owner of the server. Once you share your API keys with your apps, they can start storing, querying & doing more with your data.

## Apps on Infr:

-   [Replay](https://meetreplay.com): An open-source, private webapp that allows you to remember everything you've ever seen on the internet.
-   [Infr Desktop Client](https://github.com/InfrHQ/desktop-client): An open-source, full-stack data collection app built for PCs, Mac & Linux systems

## Is there a hosted version?

Yes! We have a hosted version of Infr available at [getinfr.com](https://getinfr.com/register). You can sign up for free and start using it right away.
